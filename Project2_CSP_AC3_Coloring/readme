The Code is written in Python language.

This code uses AC3 and Heuristics (MRV,LCV) to solve a Constraint Search Problem of graph coloring.


functions are: 
1. Initializing functions - to read inpt file, and initiate all needed structures (variables,domains,node_to_color_map etc.)

2. MRV and LVC - mrv selects next node and lvc orders colors in asciending order of their constraining value for the selected node.

3. NO_Collision - checks if selected node with selected color collides with any adjacent vertex, 
return False, if we cannot assign color to selected vertex, return True, otherwise.

4.AC3 and compare_remove_values - AC3 does forward checking until there is no more vertex pairs to check for arc consistency. 
calls compare_remove_values in while loop to remove incostent values from domains of vertex. if there is any value removed, AC3 updates deque by adding new pairs of vertices.

5. Backtracing and CSP: CSP prints the output, also calls recursive Backtracking function to solve the problem. 



INPUT:
you input path to file to run the code. such as ./input1.txt

OUTPUT:
output has a structure as following:

------------------------------------
result:

vertex: number of vertex, color: assigned color to vertex
vertex: number of vertex, color: assigned color to vertex
...
...

number of vertices:

runtime:

----------------------------------------------------------

if no soltion output will print "No Solution"

You can either use py ot ipynb file to run the code. simple python name.py in command line runs the code.
